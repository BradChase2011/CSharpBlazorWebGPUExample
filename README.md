# CSharpBlazorWebGPUExample
A simple C#, WebGPU, Blazor example that shows a triangle.

This was created because I could not find a simple all inclusive example of running WebGPU in Blazor utilizing C#.
It currently only supports .NET 9 (preview) as well as Visual Studio 22 Preview.
There might be a way to use .NET 8 utilizing the 8.0.5 libraries but I could not find a way to get non blittable types working.

This takes heavily and could not have been done without two great repository examples:

I highly suggest you check them out!
